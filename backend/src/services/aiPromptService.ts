    üíé QUALITY & STEP REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY - AUTO-GRADABLE ONLY):

    ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: ONLY use AUTO-GRADABLE question types! NO open-ended questions!
    ‚ùå NEVER ask: "Write a sentence", "Give an example", "Explain why"
    ‚úÖ ALWAYS use: Multiple choice, Fill-in-blank (exact match), True/False, Matching, Ordering

    Each lesson must contain EXACTLY 8 steps for mastery progression:
      1) THEORY - Explanation with 3-5 clear examples
      2) PRACTICE_EASY - Multiple choice (recognition, 4 options)
      3) PRACTICE_EASY - Fill-in-the-blank (EXACT one-word answer with context)
      4) PRACTICE_EASY - True/False with explanation
      5) PRACTICE_MEDIUM - Matching pairs (4-6 pairs)
      6) PRACTICE_MEDIUM - Multiple choice (harder, similar options)
      7) PRACTICE_HARD - Fill-in-blank or ordering (complex)
      8) QUIZ - Mixed questions combining all concepts from this lesson

    üéØ PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY:
    - Steps 2-4: Recognition & basic application (build confidence)
    - Steps 5-6: Deeper practice with variations
    - Steps 7-8: Challenge questions, real-world application

    üìã FILL-IN-THE-BLANK RULES (CRITICAL):
    - Must have EXACTLY ONE correct answer (no variations)
    - Provide strong context so answer is obvious
    - Use format: "He ___ (go) to school every day." with verb hint
    - correctAnswer must be exact: "goes" NOT "go" or "going"
    - Example: "She ___ (be) a doctor." ‚Üí correctAnswer: "is"

    üìã MULTIPLE CHOICE RULES:
    - Always 4 options (A, B, C, D)
    - Options must be similar enough to be challenging but clearly distinguishable
    - Include common mistakes as distractors
    - Format: "A) option text", "B) option text", etc.
    - correctAnswer: "A" (just the letter)

    üìã MATCHING RULES:
    - Include "pairs" array with 4-6 pairs
    - Format: [{ "left": "item1", "right": "match1" }, ...]
    - Each pair must have ONE clear correct match

    üìã TRUE/FALSE RULES:
    - Statement must be clearly true OR false (no ambiguity)
    - correctAnswer: "True" or "False"
    - Provide detailed explanation why

    üìã ORDERING RULES:
    - "items": ["word1", "word2", "word3", ...]
    - "correctOrder": [2, 0, 1, ...] (array of indices)
    - Use for sentence construction or sequencing

    üö´ BANNED QUESTION TYPES:
    - NO "text_entry" without exact answer
    - NO "Write a sentence using X"
    - NO "Give your own example"
    - NO "Explain in your own words"
    - These CANNOT be auto-graded reliably!

    ‚úÖ SUPPORTED content.type VALUES:
    - "multiple_choice" (4 options, one correct)
    - "fill-in-the-blank" (exact match only)
    - "true_false" (True or False)
    - "matching" (pairs array)
    - "ordering" (items + correctOrder indices)

      2) PRACTICE_EASY - Multiple choice (recognition, 4 options)
      3) PRACTICE_EASY - Fill-in-the-blank (EXACT one-word answer with context)
      4) PRACTICE_EASY - True/False with detailed explanation
      5) PRACTICE_MEDIUM - Matching pairs (4-6 pairs)
      6) PRACTICE_MEDIUM - Multiple choice (harder, similar options)
      7) PRACTICE_HARD - Fill-in-blank or ordering (complex scenario)
      8) QUIZ - Mixed questions combining all concepts from this lesson

    üéØ PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY (Build to ${difficulty} level):
    - Steps 2-4: Recognition & basic application (build confidence)
    - Steps 5-6: Deeper practice with variations
    - Steps 7-8: Challenge questions at ${difficulty} level, real-world application

    üìã FILL-IN-THE-BLANK RULES (CRITICAL):
    - Must have EXACTLY ONE correct answer (no variations)
    - Provide strong context so answer is obvious
    - Use format: "He ___ (go) to school every day." with verb hint in parentheses
    - correctAnswer must be exact: "goes" NOT "go" or "going"
    - Example: "She ___ (be) a doctor." ‚Üí correctAnswer: "is"
    - Age-appropriate for ${gradeLabel}

    üìã MULTIPLE CHOICE RULES:
    - Always 4 options (A, B, C, D)
    - Options must be similar enough to be challenging but clearly distinguishable
    - Include common mistakes that ${gradeLabel} students make as distractors
    - Format: "A) option text", "B) option text", etc.
    - correctAnswer: "A" (just the letter)

    üìã MATCHING RULES:
    - Include "pairs" array with 4-6 pairs
    - Format: [{ "left": "item1", "right": "match1" }, ...]
    - Each pair must have ONE clear correct match
    - Use terminology appropriate for ${gradeLabel}

    üìã TRUE/FALSE RULES:
    - Statement must be clearly true OR false (no ambiguity)
    - correctAnswer: "True" or "False"
    - Provide detailed explanation why (teach the concept)

    üìã ORDERING RULES:
    - "items": ["word1", "word2", "word3", ...]
    - "correctOrder": [2, 0, 1, ...] (array of indices showing correct position)
    - Use for sentence construction, sequencing steps, or chronological ordering
    - Make it age-appropriate for ${gradeLabel}

    üö´ BANNED QUESTION TYPES:
    - NO "text_entry" without exact answer
    - NO "Write a sentence using X"
    - NO "Give your own example"
    - NO "Explain in your own words"
    - These CANNOT be auto-graded reliably!

    ‚úÖ SUPPORTED content.type VALUES:
    - "multiple_choice" (4 options, one correct)
    - "fill-in-the-blank" (exact match only)
    - "true_false" (True or False)
    - "matching" (pairs array)
    - "ordering" (items + correctOrder indices)

    üéì PROGRESSION TO MASTERY:
    By the end of ${lessonCount} lessons, students should be EXPERTS at ${topic}.

    Example progression for "English Tenses" (10 lessons):
    - Lesson 1: Present Simple (recognition & formation)
    - Lesson 2: Present Continuous (is/am/are + verb-ing)
    - Lesson 3: Past Simple (regular & irregular)
    - Lesson 4: Past Continuous (was/were + verb-ing)
    - Lesson 5: Present Perfect (have/has + past participle)
    - Lesson 6: Present Perfect Continuous (have been + verb-ing)
    - Lesson 7: Future Tenses (will, going to, present continuous for future)
    - Lesson 8: Past Perfect & Past Perfect Continuous
    - Lesson 9: Mixed Tense Recognition (the HARD part - identify tense in context)
    - Lesson 10: Real-World Mastery (news articles, emails, complex sentences)

    Follow this progressive model for ALL topics:
    - Lessons 1-3: Individual concepts (one at a time, build confidence)
    - Lessons 4-6: Related concepts (compare/contrast, avoid confusion)
    - Lessons 7-8: Integration (combine multiple concepts)
    - Lessons 9-10: Mastery (mixed problems, real-world application, expert level)
    - Each lesson builds on previous - NO gaps in knowledge!
