## 🔧 **Fixes Implemented**

### Exam Controller (`examController.ts`)
```javascript
// Fixed: Removed 'explanation' field (doesn't exist in schema)
// Fixed: Made difficulty optional with fallback
difficulty: validatedData.difficulty?.toLowerCase() || 'medium'
```

### Study Module Controller (`studyModuleController.ts`)
```javascript
// Fixed: Added required 'topic' field in test data
// Fixed: Changed difficulty from 'MEDIUM' to 'medium' (lowercase)
```

### Assignment Prevention (Both Controllers)
```javascript
// Added duplicate check before creating assignments
const existingAssignments = await prisma.examAssignment.findMany({
  where: {
    examId: id,
    studentId: { in: studentIds }
  }
});

if (existingAssignments.length > 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    success: false,
    message: `Exam already assigned to: ${duplicateStudents}. Cannot assign the same exam twice to a student.`
  });
}
```
